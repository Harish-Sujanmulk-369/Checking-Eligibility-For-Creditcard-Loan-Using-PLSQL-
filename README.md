1.DDL,DML,TCL,DRL COMMANDS

2.SUBSTR()      -->The SUBSTR() function extracts a substring from a string (starting at any position).

3.Count         -->The COUNT() function returns the number of rows in the result set.

4.Procedure     -->A procedure is a subprogram that performs a specific action. A procedure invocation (or call) is a statement.
                    Before invoking a procedure, you must declare and define it.
              
5.IN and OUT    -->An IN OUT parameter passes an initial value to a subprogram and returns an updated value to the caller.

6.To_Char       -->TO_CHAR function is used to typecast a numeric or date input to character type with a format model.

7.Trim          -->TRIM function is used for removing all specified characters either from the beginning or the end of a string.

8.||            -->The ||(Pipe Symbol) Operator in PLSQL is used to concatenate 2 or more strings together.

9.IF and END IF -->Control Statements.

10.Exception    -->An exception is a PL/SQL error that is raised during program execution, either implicitly by TimesTen or explicitly by your program. Handle an                             exception by trapping it with a handler or propagating it to the calling environment.

11.Anonymous Block-->The PL/SQL anonymous block statement is an executable statement that can contain PL/SQL control statements and SQL statements. It can be used to implement procedural logic in a scripting language.
